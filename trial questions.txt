✅ 1. What is the speed if a person covers 100 meters in 20 seconds?
Distance: 100

Time (seconds): 20

Option: Speed (Option 1)

👉 Expected Answer:

Speed= Time/Distance = 20/100 = 5m/s

✅ 2. What is the velocity if displacement is 60 meters in 15 seconds?
Displacement: 60

Time (seconds): 15

Option: Velocity (Option 2)

👉 Expected Answer:

Velocity= 60/15 = 4m/s

✅ 3. Find the displacement when velocity is 10 m/s and time is 6 seconds.
Velocity: 10

Time (seconds): 6

Option: Displacement (Option 3)

👉 Expected Answer:

Displacement = 𝑣×𝑡 = 10×6 = 60m

✅ 4. How much time is required to cover a displacement of 120 meters at 30 m/s?
Displacement: 120

Velocity: 30

Option: Time (Option 4)

👉 Expected Answer:

Time= Velocity/Displacement = 120/30 = 4seconds

✅ 5. What is the acceleration if initial velocity is 5 m/s, final velocity is 25 m/s, and time is 4 seconds?
Initial Velocity: 5

Velocity (Final): 25

Time: 4

Option: Acceleration (Option 5)

👉 Expected Answer:


Acceleration= v-u/t = 25-5/4 = 20/4 = 5m/s²
