1. Focal length calculation

Question:
An object is placed 30 cm from a lens, and its image is formed 60 cm on the other side. What is the focal length of the lens?

Given:

u = -30 cm (object distance is negative in Cartesian convention)

v = 60 cm

✅ In your calculator, enter u = 30, v = 60 → f = 20 cm (if you ignore the sign convention for simplicity).

2. Magnification using heights

Question:
An object of height 5 cm forms an image of height 10 cm. What is the magnification?


✅ Enter ho = 5, hi = 10 → magnification = 2

3. Magnification using distances

Question:
Object distance = 20 cm, image distance = 40 cm. Find magnification.


✅ Enter u = 20, v = 40 → magnification = 2

4. Lens power

Question:
A convex lens has a focal length of 25 cm. Find its power.


✅ Enter f = 25 → power = 4 D

5. Combined check

u = 15 cm, v = 30 cm

ho = 4 cm, hi = 8 cm

f = leave empty

Expected results:

Focal length: 30 cm

Magnification: 2

Power: 100/30 ≈ 3.33 D
